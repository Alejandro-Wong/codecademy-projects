Notable Codecademy projects completed

- CreditcardChecker: "Challenge project" in Codecademy's JavaScript Syntax II course. Uses Luhn's algorithm to validate credit card numbers, then identifies invalid credit card numbers and the credit card companies they belong to from and array of arrays.

- BookFinder: Codecademy certification exam problem. Simple keyword search model for a hypothetical book finder website. I thought this would be interesting as a project to add to an build upon as I continue to progress in my lessons.

- FilmFinder: Project that demonstrates use of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that recommends random movies by genre.
